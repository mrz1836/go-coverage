# Implementation Plan: GitHub Actions Integration for go-coverage

## Document Version
- **Plan ID**: PLAN-01
- **Created**: 2025-08-28
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Objective**: Reduce .github/workflows/fortress-coverage.yml from 2,156 lines to ~50 lines

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a new `github-actions` command for go-coverage that will consolidate complex GitHub Actions workflows into a single, intelligent command. The implementation will be executed in 6 distinct phases, each designed to be completed in a single Claude Code session with clear deliverables and progress tracking.

### Important Context
**⚠️ This software is not yet in production use.** We have complete freedom to:
- Make breaking changes without migration paths
- Redesign interfaces and APIs as needed
- Remove or restructure existing code
- Implement the cleanest, most efficient solution
- No backward compatibility requirements
- No migration guides needed

### Key Goals
- ✅ Reduce workflow complexity by 95%
- ✅ Zero external dependencies
- ✅ Automatic environment detection
- ✅ Intelligent error recovery
- ✅ Clean implementation without legacy constraints

---

### Implementation Details

#### 8.1 README.md Updates
```markdown
**CLI Tool**: `go-coverage` with 7 core commands:
- `github-actions` - Automated GitHub Actions integration (NEW!)
- `complete` - Full pipeline (parse + badge + report + history)
- `comment` - Generate PR comments with coverage analysis
- `parse` - Parse coverage data with exclusions and thresholds
- `history` - View coverage trends and historical data
- `setup-pages` - Configure GitHub Pages environment
- `upgrade` - Check for updates and upgrade to latest version
```

#### 8.2 New Examples
```bash
# NEW: Single command for GitHub Actions
go-coverage github-actions --input=coverage.txt

# Replaces 2,156 lines of workflow with one command!
```

#### 8.3 First Release Notes
- This is shipping with the first release
- No migration needed (software not yet in use)
- Clean implementation without legacy constraints
- Production-ready with security hardening

### Deliverables
- [ ] Updated README.md with new command
- [ ] Updated CLAUDE.md with new command

### Session Progress Tracking
```yaml
status: NOT_STARTED
started_at: null
completed_at: null
blockers: []
notes: ""
```

### 📝 Agent Instructions for Phase Completion

**Before starting this phase:**
1. Update `status` to `IN_PROGRESS` and set `started_at` timestamp
2. Review all dependencies and ensure previous phases are complete
3. Create a branch named `feat/github-actions-integration` (or continue using existing branch)

**During implementation:**
1. Check off completed items in the checklist above
2. Document any design decisions in the `notes` field
3. Add any blockers encountered to the `blockers` list
4. Run `magex lint` regularly to catch issues early
5. Fix all linter issues before final commit
6. Commit progress incrementally with descriptive messages

**Upon completion:**
1. Update `status` to `COMPLETED` and set `completed_at` timestamp
2. Ensure all checklist items are marked complete
3. Update the Phase Completion table at the bottom of this document
4. Document any deviations from the original plan
5. CREATE THE FINAL PR after this phase (user will handle the actual PR creation)
6. Pass the baton with a summary of the complete implementation

| 8     | NOT_STARTED | -       | -         | -     | Documentation & Release     |

## Document Updates

Each Claude Code agent session should update:
1. Session Progress Tracking for their phase
2. Check off completed items in Checklist
3. Update Phase Completion table
4. Add notes about decisions or blockers
5. Update Overall Status if phase completed

## Branch Management

**IMPORTANT**: All phases will be implemented in a SINGLE branch:
- Branch name: `feat/github-actions-integration`
- First agent creates the branch (if it doesn't exist)
- Subsequent agents continue on the same branch
- Final PR created only after Phase 8 completion, but the user will create the PR
- Each phase commits incrementally to maintain history
