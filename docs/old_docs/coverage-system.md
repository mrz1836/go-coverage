## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/architecture.svg)

The system consists of several key components working together to provide comprehensive coverage analysis:

### Core Components

#### 1. **Coverage Engine** (`.github/coverage/internal/`)
The heart of the system, implemented as a separate Go module with isolated dependencies:

```
.github/coverage/
├── cmd/gofortress-coverage/     # CLI tool and main entry point
├── internal/
│   ├── parser/                  # Go coverage file parsing and analysis
│   ├── badge/                   # SVG badge generation with multiple themes
│   ├── report/                  # Interactive HTML report generation
│   ├── history/                 # Historical data tracking and trend analysis
│   ├── github/                  # GitHub API integration and PR management
│   ├── config/                  # Configuration management and validation
│   ├── analytics/               # Advanced analytics and predictions
│   └── notify/                  # Multi-channel notification system
└── go.mod                       # Isolated dependency management
```

#### 2. **GitHub Actions Integration**
Seamless workflow integration with existing CI/CD pipelines:

- **fortress-coverage.yml**: Main coverage processing workflow
- **fortress-test-suite.yml**: Test execution with coverage artifact upload
- **fortress.yml**: Master workflow orchestration

#### 3. **GitHub Pages Deployment**
Automated static site generation and deployment:

- **Dashboard**: Interactive coverage visualization
- **Reports**: Detailed coverage analysis by branch/PR
- **Badges**: Real-time SVG badge generation
- **API**: JSON endpoints for external integrations

#### 4. **Storage Architecture**
Organized file structure on GitHub Pages:

```
https://{owner}.github.io/{repo}/
├── badges/
│   ├── main.svg                 # Main branch coverage badge
│   ├── develop.svg              # Develop branch badge
│   └── pr/
│       └── 123.svg              # PR-specific badges
├── reports/
│   ├── main/                    # Main branch reports
│   ├── develop/                 # Develop branch reports
│   └── pr/
│       └── 123/                 # PR-specific reports
├── api/
│   ├── coverage.json            # Latest coverage data
│   ├── history.json             # Historical trends
│   └── analytics.json           # Advanced metrics
└── index.html                   # Interactive dashboard
```

## System Workflow

4. **Validation**: Comprehensive configuration validation

### Key Configuration Areas

#### Coverage Processing
```bash
COVERAGE_FAIL_UNDER=80                    # Minimum acceptable coverage
COVERAGE_EXCLUDE_PATHS=vendor/,test/      # Paths to exclude
COVERAGE_EXCLUDE_FILES=*_test.go          # File patterns to exclude
COVERAGE_THRESHOLD_EXCELLENT=90           # Green badge threshold
```

#### GitHub Integration
```bash
COVERAGE_PR_COMMENT_ENABLED=true          # Enable PR comments
COVERAGE_PR_COMMENT_BEHAVIOR=update       # Comment update strategy
COVERAGE_PAGES_AUTO_CREATE=true           # Auto-create GitHub Pages
```

#### Analytics & Reporting
```bash
COVERAGE_ENABLE_TREND_ANALYSIS=true       # Historical trend tracking
COVERAGE_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS=90        # Data retention period
COVERAGE_ENABLE_PACKAGE_BREAKDOWN=true    # Package-level analysis
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **No External Transmission**: All data processing occurs within GitHub infrastructure
- **Token Security**: GitHub tokens never logged or transmitted
- **Access Control**: Respects repository permissions and visibility
- **Audit Logging**: Complete operation tracking for compliance

### Threat Model
- **Supply Chain Security**: Isolated dependencies with vulnerability scanning
- **Code Injection**: Input sanitization and validation at all layers
- **Privilege Escalation**: Minimal required permissions (contents: write, pages: write)
- **Data Leakage**: Automatic sensitive data redaction

- **Automatic Recovery**: System self-heals from GitHub data
- **Backup Strategy**: Historical data preserved in git history

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Lost Configuration**: Restore from `.github/.env.shared` backup
2. **Corrupted Pages**: Redeploy from latest successful commit
3. **Missing History**: Reconstruct from git commit metadata
4. **Service Outage**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
